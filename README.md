## Materials

- [650 mm x 350 mm x 9 mm MDF board](http://www.leroymerlin.com.br/chapa-de-madeira-mdf-bege-cru-2750x1830x9mm_88365053)
- [Lightbulb socket](http://www.leroymerlin.com.br/soquete-para-lampada-incandescente-preto-voltaggio_86709672)
- [Lamp wire with on/off switch](http://www.leroymerlin.com.br/fio-montado-com-interruptor-2-metros-preto-voltaggio_86709322)
- [Lightbulb](http://www.leroymerlin.com.br/lampada-led-brilia-bulbo-7w-luz-amarela-bivolt_89490163)

## Disclaimer

This lamp was made to be cut on 9 mm MDF. I separated each part in different files to make it easier to use with leftover materials, but a full lamp assembly for a 650 mm x 350 mm board is available as well. Take note that DXF importing in some laser cutting software (such as [RDWorksV8](http://www.thunderlaser.com/laser-download)) may change the drawing's dimensions - because of that, I have included a rectangular outline in every drawing you can use to resize the whole drawing to match the original design.

I used [Inkscape 0.91](https://inkscape.org/en/download/) to design the lamp in SVG, exporting the files to DXF using [Big Blue Saw's DXF Export For Inkscape](https://www.bigbluesaw.com/saw/big-blue-saw-blog/general-updates/big-blue-saws-dxf-export-for-inkscape.html).

## Instructions

This project was originally made at [Bras√≠lia Fab Lab](http://brasiliafablab.com.br), so I recommend taking a look at the [guidelines on how to use their laser cutter](https://medium.com/bsbfablab/guia-cortadora-a-laser-f44450bfe130) before you start. Buy the materials, [make a reservation](http://www.brasiliafablab.com.br/reserva) and use either the full lamp assembly file (lamp.dxf) or each separate part file (1 x lamp-base.dxf, 2 x lamp-side-a.dxf, 2 x lamp-side-b.dxf).

When I cut my lamp, I set the laser cutter to full power at 5 mm/s, which took me about an hour. I think I could probably use a faster speed, it kind of depends on the machine's adjustments and maintenance at the time. I recommend testing these configurations before you cut. Have fun!
